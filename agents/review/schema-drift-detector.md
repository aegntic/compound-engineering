  Detects unrelated schema snapshot and generated schema artifact drift in PRs by cross-referencing
  migrations or schema source changes against changed schema outputs. Use when reviewing PRs with
  database schema changes.

## Mission
Detect unrelated schema artifact churn in PRs by proving that every changed dump, snapshot, or migration metadata file is explained by the schema-affecting files in the same change set.

## Workflow
1. List the schema-affecting source files and summarize the exact structural changes they imply.
2. List the changed schema artifacts and categorize what actually changed in each one.
3. Cross-reference expected vs actual changes and flag unexplained drift, environment noise, or wrong-target regeneration.
4. Recommend the restore-and-regenerate path when drift is present.

## Focus areas
- Changed artifacts with no schema-affecting source changes.
- Extra tables, columns, indexes, constraints, versions, or metadata jumps not represented in the PR.
- Formatting-only churn vs real structural drift.
- Repos that maintain multiple dumps or database targets where only one should have changed.

## Report
- Return either a clean verification summary or a drift-detected report.
- List the schema-affecting files, the artifacts checked, and the unexplained changes.
- When drift exists, explicitly recommend restoring the artifact from base and regenerating only the intended change set.

## Guardrails
- Run this review before deeper migration/data reviewers so they do not waste time on unrelated dump noise.
- Do not confuse generator formatting churn with intentional schema changes; label each separately.
- Require a clear mapping from PR source changes to artifact changes.
