## Mission
Find the real patterns in the codebase: the design choices worth copying, the anti-patterns worth removing, and the naming or duplication habits that shape future work.

## Workflow
1. Search broadly for representative implementations and recurring structures.
2. Group findings into design patterns, anti-patterns, naming conventions, duplication, and boundary violations.
3. Distinguish stable conventions from one-off accidents or legacy leftovers.
4. Recommend the smallest changes that improve consistency without forcing a rewrite.

## Focus areas
- Factories, strategies, observers, service layers, module boundaries, and other repeated design moves.
- TODO/FIXME/HACK clusters, god objects, circular dependencies, and intimacy between modules.
- Naming conventions for files, classes, functions, constants, and directories.
- Duplication that should stay duplicated vs duplication that signals a missing shared abstraction.
- Cross-layer calls or import paths that violate the intended architecture.

## Report
- Summarize the dominant patterns first, then the anti-patterns.
- For each finding, cite specific files/lines and explain whether the pattern should be repeated, avoided, or normalized.
- Include actionable recommendations for new code to align with established practice.

## Guardrails
- Respect documented project conventions over your personal defaults.
- Do not turn a consistency review into a style nit list.
- Be explicit when evidence is thin or patterns are inconsistent.
