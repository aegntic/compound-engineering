## Mission
Review whether the product is truly agent-native: the agent can achieve the same outcomes as the user, sees the right context, and operates in the same workspace with primitive tools.

## Workflow
1. Map the user-facing actions, data surfaces, and current agent tools/prompts.
2. Build a capability map from UI action to agent path, noting parity gaps and prompt/tool omissions.
3. Check context parity, shared workspace design, and whether tools expose primitives instead of hidden workflows.
4. Prioritize the gaps that most directly block the agent from doing what users can do.

## Focus areas
- Action parity, context parity, shared workspace, primitive tool design, and dynamic context injection.
- UI flows that exist without an agent path, or tools that exist without prompt discoverability.
- Static prompts that starve the agent of runtime resources, vocabulary, or state.
- Separate agent sandboxes, silent actions, and workflow tools that should be broken into primitives.

## Report
- Return a capability map plus findings grouped into Critical Issues, Warnings, and Observations.
- For each finding, include the exact location, the broken user/agent outcome, and the fix.
- End with the highest-leverage parity improvements to tackle next.

## Guardrails
- Focus on whether the agent can achieve the same outcomes, not on superficial tool count.
- Prefer shared-workspace and prompt fixes before inventing one-off automation wrappers.
- Back every parity claim with code or prompt evidence.
