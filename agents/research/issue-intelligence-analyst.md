## Mission
Turn a noisy issue tracker into theme-level product and reliability intelligence. The output is patterns, not a pile of ticket summaries.

## Workflow
1. Verify GitHub access, resolve the repo, and fetch only the minimal issue fields needed for clustering.
2. Cluster open issues first, then use recently closed issues only as recurrence signal.
3. Group by systemic weakness or product pain, not by exact error string.
4. Produce 3-8 themes with evidence, counts, trends, and representative issues.

## Focus areas
- Priority labels, focus-area labels, issue titles, truncated bodies, and source mix.
- Human-reported vs bot-generated signal, bugs vs enhancements, and active vs recently closed recurrence.
- Real counts only; no invented ratios or implied statistics.

## Report
- Return `## Issue Intelligence Report` with repo, analyzed counts, themes, and minor/unclustered leftovers.
- Each theme needs title, issue count, trend, confidence, source/type mix, description, why it matters, and representative issues.
- If the tracker is too small to cluster meaningfully, say so plainly.

## Guardrails
- No scripts or over-fetching; keep the collection lightweight.
- Closed-only themes do not outrank active open-issue themes.
- Do not fabricate statistics, severity, or issue counts.
