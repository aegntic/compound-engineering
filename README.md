## Why Compound Engineering?

| Problem | Solution |
|---------|----------|
| AI agents solve the same problem twice | `/workflows:compound` documents every solved problem as searchable knowledge |
| Code review is shallow and generic | 17 specialized reviewers per language and domain (Rust ownership, TypeScript types, OWASP security) |
| Planning disconnected from execution | Pipeline produces artifacts that feed the next phase — nothing is lost |
| One-shot features need manual handoffs | `/lfg` chains plan → deepen → work → review → ship autonomously |
| Knowledge leaves with the developer | `docs/solutions/` compounds institutional memory in git |

## Install

For **Claude Code**, **Copilot CLI**, **OpenCode**, or any agent that supports skills/commands.

```bash
# Claude Code — install as plugin
claude install-plugin https://github.com/aegntic/compound-engineering

# Or clone directly into your skills directory
git clone https://github.com/aegntic/compound-engineering.git \
  ~/.claude/skills/compound-engineering

# Configure for your stack (detects languages, frameworks, picks reviewers)
/setup
```

## The Workflow

Compound Engineering provides a progression of workflows that build on each other. Each phase produces artifacts that feed the next, so nothing is lost and context compounds.

```
/constitution → /ideate → /brainstorm → /plan → /deepen-plan → /work → /review → /compound
                                                                                    ↑
                                                    knowledge feeds back ─────────────┘
```

| Phase | Command | What it does |
|-------|---------|-------------|
| **Define** | `/workflows:constitution` | Establish durable project principles in `docs/constitution.md` |
| **Discover** | `/workflows:ideate` | Scan the repo, generate improvement ideas, rank them |
| **Explore** | `/workflows:brainstorm` | Establish WHY and WHAT — problem narrative, user story, architectural context |
| **Plan** | `/workflows:plan` | Structured implementation plan with tasks, dependencies, and evidence contracts |
| **Deepen** | `/deepen-plan` | Expand thin spots in the plan before execution begins |
| **Execute** | `/workflows:work` | TDD-driven execution with red-green-refactor evidence capture |
| **Review** | `/workflows:review` | Multi-agent code review using your configured reviewers |
| **Compound** | `/workflows:compound` | Document the solved problem as searchable knowledge in `docs/solutions/` |

### One-Shot Autonomous Mode

For features that don't need exploration — go straight to shipping:

```bash
/lfg add user authentication with JWT
```

This chains the entire pipeline automatically: plan → deepen → work → review → resolve → test → video → done.

For parallel swarm execution:

```bash
/slfg add user authentication with JWT
```

## Project Structure

```

├── platforms/             # Platform-specific hooks
└── plugin.yaml            # Plugin metadata
```

## Docs Convention

Workflows produce structured output in your project's `docs/` directory:

```
docs/
├── constitution.md        # Project principles (keep in git)
├── solutions/             # Compounded learnings (keep in git)
├── ideation/              # Ideation artifacts (gitignore)
├── plans/                 # Implementation plans (gitignore)
├── brainstorms/           # Brainstorm documents (gitignore)
└── execution-sessions/    # Work session logs (gitignore)
```

Solutions are institutional memory — the compounding payoff. Everything else is ephemeral scaffolding.

## Configuration

Run `/setup` to create `compound-engineering.local.md` in your project root. It auto-detects your stack and selects the right language reviewers for `/workflows:review`.

## MCP Integration

Includes Context7 MCP server for enhanced documentation lookup during research and review.
